Scope
---------------------------

## let
With 'let', we declare local functions within the code block.


## const
The 'const' variables are used to declare constant variables. 
Their range is analogous to the 'let' variables.
The only difference is that once assigned value to a variable, can not be changed anymore.


## var
The scope of these variables is limited to the function in which they were declared
or to the global space if they were declared outside the function.


## no modifier
Declaration of a variable without any modifier is tantamount to assigning it to the global space.
